### About ###

My name is Kai. I live in Seattle, and I'm self-employed as an independent software developer — I design and build apps for people to use.

Taking meds and supplements every day can be a chore. It's easy to forget. Sometimes I remember, but then I'm not entirely sure if I've already taken them earlier that day. 

And when I do take them, I'm reminded of my body's limitations; after all — there's a reason why I need to take these meds — and it's not an entirely pleasant feeling.

So I thought I'd design an app that helps me remember my pills, and also adds a bit of delight and fun into this process.

I hope it helps you out too.

If you enjoy Pill Buddy, I'd appreciate a review on the App Store. Every rating counts, especially for a new app.

If you encounter any issues while using the app or have suggestions on how I can make it better, please email me at kai@autographlabs.com.

Please also feel free to check out my other apps — Ka Chinese Tones ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ka-learn-chinese-tones/id6444140899?pt=117273943&ct=web&mt=8%3Fitsct%3Dapps_box_badge&itscg=30200) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autographlabs.kachinesetones)), and Around the World in Trivia ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/around-the-world-in-trivia/id6451456346)).
